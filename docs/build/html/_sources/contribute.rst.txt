Create a .pypirc file
---------------------

Create a `.pypirc <https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/pypirc/>`_ file with following content in your local home directory to avoid typing your PyPI username and password each time.

.. code-block:: none

   [testpypi]
   repository = https://test.pypi.org/legacy/
   username = <my_test_pypi_username>
   password = <my_test_pypi_password>

   [pypi]
   repository = https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/
   username = <my_pypi_username>
   password = <my_pypi_password>
