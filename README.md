```

## Usage

```python

import sklearn.datasets

# load diabetes dataset from sklearn
diab = sklearn.datasets.load_diabetes()
# 442x4 matrix with scaled features: age, sex, bmi, blood pressure
X = diab.data[:, 1:4]
y = diab.target
# Lets introduce some faulty entries
X[100, 1] = 0.8
X[200, 2] = 0.7
X[300, 3] = 0.1
X[400, 4] = 0.2
# Lets detect (and correct) them using adadmire
ca = adadmire.detect_anomalies(X)
print(ca)
X_corrected = adadmire.correct_anomalies(X)
```
