1. **Make your code changes**
2. **Increase the version** in [pyproject.toml](../pyproject.toml)
3. **Build the package**:
   * Run command `python -m pip install --upgrade build twine` to install modules [build](https://pypi.org/project/build/) and [twine](https://pypi.org/project/twine/) (required for building and uploading of packages) 
   * Run command `python -m build` to generate pre-built version of your package (`dist/adadmire*.whl`) as well as a source version of your package (`dist/adadmire*.tar.gz`)

   * Run command `python -m pip install --upgrade --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --no-deps adadmire` to check that your new version can be installed via pip
5. **Upload to PyPI Production Server**
   * Run command `python -m twine upload dist/*` to upload your package to [test.pypi.org](https://test.pypi.org/). **Important**: for this to work, you need to create an account at [pypi.org](https://pypi.org/) first!
